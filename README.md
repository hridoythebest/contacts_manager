This project is a simple contact manager application that allows users to create, edit, and delete contacts. It is built using Django, a popular Python web framework. The project uses Bootstrap to style the user interface.

The project includes the following features:

* Create new contacts
* Edit existing contacts
* Delete contacts
* View a list of all contacts
* Search for contacts

The project is a good starting point for learning Django and Bootstrap. It can also be used as a base for more complex contact manager applications."


some upcoming features for the contact manager project:
Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. This is done to ensure that only authorized users can access the application.
Authorization is the process of determining what actions a user is allowed to perform. This is done to protect the application from unauthorized access.
Sort, filter, and search are features that allow users to find the contacts they are looking for.
Pagination is a feature that allows users to view a limited number of contacts at a time. This is done to improve performance and to make the application more user-friendly.
Robust security features are important to protect the application from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

* **Import and export contacts:** Users should be able to import and export contacts from a CSV file. This would make it easy to transfer contacts from another contact manager application or to back up the contacts.
* **Categorize contacts:** Users should be able to categorize their contacts. This would make it easier to find contacts and to manage their contact lists.
* **Add custom fields:** Users should be able to add custom fields to their contacts. This would allow them to store more information about their contacts, such as their birthday, anniversary, or favorite color.
* **Send email notifications:** Users should be able to send email notifications to their contacts. This would be useful for things like birthday reminders or event invitations.
* **Search by location:** Users should be able to search for contacts by location. This would be useful for finding contacts who are nearby.
